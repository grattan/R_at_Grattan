# Grattan coding style {#coding-style}

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The benefits of a common coding style are well explained [by Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html):

> Good style is important because while your code only has one author, it’ll usually have multiple readers. This is especially true when you’re writing code with others. In that case, it’s a good idea to agree on a common style up-front.

Below we describe the **key** elements of Grattan coding style, without being too tedious about it all. There are many elements of coding style we don't cover in this guide; if you're unsure about anything, [consult the `tidyverse` guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). 

You should also see the [Using R at Grattan](#organising-projects) page for guidelines about setting up projects.

## Script preamble

Describe what your script does in the first few lines using comments or within an RMarkdown document.

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This script reads ABS data downloaded from TableBuilder and combines into a single data object containing post-secondary education levels by age and gender by SA3. 
```

Your preamble might also pose a research question that the script will answer.

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Do women have higher levels of educational attainment than men, within the same geographical areas and age groups?
```

Your preamble shouldn't be a terse, inscrutable comment.

**Bad**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# make ABS ed data graph
```

If it's hard to concisely describe what your script does in a few lines of plain English, that might be a sign that your script does too many things. Consider breaking your analysis into a series of scripts. See [Organising R Projects at Grattan](#organising-projects) for more.

Your preamble should anticipate and answer any questions other people might have when reviewing your script. For example:

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This script calculates average income by age group and sex using the ABS Household Expenditure Survey and joins this to health information by age groups and sex from the National Health Survey. Note that we can't use the income variable in the NHS for this purpose, as it only contains information about respondents' income decile, not the income itself.
```

The preamble should pertain the the code contained in the specific script. If you have comments or information about your analysis as a whole, put it in your [README file](#README).

## Use comments {#use-comments}

Comments are necessary where the code _alone_ doesn't tell the full story. Comments should tell the reader **why** you're doing something, rather than just **what** you're doing. 

For example, comments are important when groups are coded with numbers rather than character strings, because this might not be obvious to someone reading your script:

**Necessary to comment**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>% 
  filter(gender == 1,   # Keep only male observations
         age == "05")   # Keep only 35-39 year-olds. 
```

Without the comment, readers of your code might not be aware that `1` in this dataset corresponds to `male`, or that `age == "05"` refers to 35-39 year olds. Without the comment, the code is not self-explanatory.

If your code _is_ self-explanatory, you can include or omit comments as you see fit.

**Not necessary (but okay if included)**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# We want to only look at women aged 35-39
data %>% 
  filter(gender == "Female",
         age >= 35 & age <= 39)
```

You should also include comments where your code is more complex and may not be easily understood by the reader. If you're using a function from a package that isn't commonly used at Grattan, include a comment to explain what it does.

_Err on the side of commenting more_, rather than less, throughout your code. Something may seem obvious to you when you're writing your code, but it might not be obvious to the person reading your code, even if that person is you in the future. Better to over-comment than under-comment.

Comments can go above code chunks, or next to code - there are examples of both above. 

## Breaking your script into chunks

It's useful to break a lengthy script into chunks with `-----`. 

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Read file A -----

a <- read_csv("data/a.csv")

# Read file B -----

b <- read_csv("data/b.csv")

# Combine files A and B ----

c <- bind_rows(a, b)

```

This helps you, and others, navigate your code better, using the navigation tool built in to RStudio. In the script editor pane of RStudio, at the bottom left, there's a little navigation tool that helps you easily jump between named sections of your script. 

```{r rstudio_nav, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("atlas/rstudio_navigation.png")
```

Breaking your script into chunks with `-----` also makes your code easier to read.

## Assigning values to objects

In R, you work with objects. An object might be a data frame, or a vector of numbers or letters, or a list. Functions can be objects, too.

 **Use the `<-` operator to assign values to objects**. Here are some **good** examples:
```{r assignment-good, eval=FALSE}
schools <- read_csv("data/schools_data.csv")

three_letters <- c("a", "b", "c")

lf <- labour_force %>%
  filter(status != "NILF")
```

Avoid `->`, `=` and `assign()`. Here are some **bad** examples::

```{r assignment-bad, eval=FALSE}
schools = read_csv("data/schools_data.csv")

assign("three_letters", c("a", "b", "c"))

labour_force %>%
  filter(status != "NILF") -> lf

```

All these bad operators will work, but they are best avoided. The `=` operator is avoided for reasons of visual consistency, style, and to avoid confusion. `assign()` is avoided because it can lead to unexpected behaviour, and is usually not the best way to do what you want to do. The `->` operator is avoided because it's easy to miss when skimming over code.

The `<<-` operator should also be avoided. 

## Naming objects and variables

It's important to be consistent when naming things. This saves you time when writing code. If you use a consistent naming convention, you don't need to stop to remember if your object is called `ed_by_age` or `edByAge` or `ed.by.age`. Having a consistent naming convention across Grattan also makes it easy to read and QC each other's code.

Grattan primarily uses _words separated by underscores_ `_` (aka 'snake_case') to name objects and variables. This is [considered good practice across the Tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#object-names). 
Object names should be descriptive and not-too-long. This is a trade-off, and one that's sometimes hard to get right. However, using snake_case provides consistency:

**Good object names**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
sa3_population
gdp_growth_vic
uni_attainment
```

**Bad object names**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
sa3Pop
GDPgrowthVIC
uni.attainment
```

Variable names face a similar trade-off. Again, try to be descriptive and short using snake_case:

**Good variable names**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gender
gdp_growth
highest_edu
```

**Bad variable names**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
s801LHSAA
gdp.growth
highEdu
chaosVar_name.silly
var2
```

When you load data from outside Grattan, such as ABS microdata, variables will often have bad names. It is worth taking the time at the top of your script to [rename your variables](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html), giving them consistent, descriptive, short, snake_case names. 

The most important thing is that your code is internally consistent - you should stick to one naming convention for all your objects and variables. Using snake_case, which we strongly recommend, reduces friction for other people reading and editing your code. Using short names saves effort when coding. Using descriptive names makes your code easier to read and understand.

## Spacing

Giving your code room to breathe greatly helps readability for future-you and others who will have to read your code. Code without ample whitespace is hard to read, justasitishardertoreadEnglishsentenceswithoutspaces.

### Assign and equals

Put a space each side of an assign operator `<-`, equals `=`, and other 'infix operators' (`==`, `+`, `-`, and so on).

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
uni_attainment <- filter(data, age == 25, gender == "Female")
```

**Bad**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
uni_attainment<-filter(data,age==25,gender=="Female")
```

Exceptions are operators that _directly connect_ to an object, package or function, which should **not** have spaces on either side: `::`, `$`, `@`, `[`, `[[`, etc.

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
uni_attainment$gender
uni_attainment$age[1:10]
readabs::read_abs()
```

**Bad**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
uni_attainment $ gender
uni_attainment$ age [ 1 : 10]
readabs :: read_abs()
```


### Commas
Always put a space _after_ a comma and not before, just like in regular English.

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(data, age, gender, sa2, sa3)
```

**Bad**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(data,age,gender,sa2,sa3)
```

### Parentheses

Do not use spaces around parentheses in most cases:

**Good**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

**Bad**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
mean( x, na.rm = TRUE )
```

For spacing rules around `if`, `for`, `while`, and `function`, see [the Tidyverse guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#parentheses). 

## Short lines and line indentation 

It's tedious -- yes -- but short lines and consistent line indentation can help make reading code much easier. If you are supplying multiple arguments to a function, it's generally a good idea to put each argument on a new line - hit return after the comma, like in the `rename` and `filter` examples below. Indentation makes it clear where a code block starts and finishes.

Using pipes (`%>%`) instead of nesting functions also makes things clearer.[^The pipe is from the `magrittr` package and is used to chain functions together, so that the output from one function becomes the input to the next function. The pipe is loaded as part of the [`tidyverse`](#tidyverse).] The pipe should always have a space before it, and should generally be followed by a new line, as in this example:

**Good: short lines and indentation**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
young_qual_income <- data %>%
  rename(gender = s801LHSAA,
         uni_attainment = high.ed) %>%
  filter(income > 0,
         age >= 25 & age <= 34) %>%
  group_by(gender, uni_attainment) %>%
  summarise(mean_income = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Without indentation, the code is harder to read. It's not clear where the chunk starts and finishes, and which bits of code are arguments to which functions.

**Bad: short lines, no indentation**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
young_qual_income <- data %>% 
rename(gender = s801LHSAA,
uni_attainment = high.ed) %>% 
filter(income > 0,
age >= 25 & age <= 34) %>%
group_by(gender, uni_attainment) %>% 
summarise(mean_income = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Long lines are also bad and hard to read.
**Bad: long lines**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
young_qual_income <- data %>% rename(gender = s801LHSAA, uni_attainment = high.ed) %>% filter(income > 0, age >= 25 & age <= 34) %>% group_by(gender, uni_attainment) %>% summarise(mean_income = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE))
```

When you want to take the output of a function and pass it as the input to another function, use the pipe (`%>%`). Don't write ugly, inscrutable code like this, where multiple functions are wrapped around other functions.

**War-crime bad: long lines without pipes**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
young_qual_income<-summarise(group_by(filter(rename(data,gender=s801LHSAA,uni_attainment=high.ed),income>0,age>=25&age<=34),uni_attainment),mean_income=mean(income,na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Blocks of code

As shown above, the pipe function `%>%` can make code more easy to write and read. The pipe can create the temptation to string together lots and lots of functions into one block of code. This can make things harder to read and understand. 

Resist the urge to use the pipe to make code blocks too long. A block of code should generally do one thing, or a small number of things.
