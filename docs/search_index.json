Some packages - like the tidyverse collection of packages - are broadly popular among R users. Some - like the grattantheme package - are specific to Grattan Institute. Others - like the readabs package - are made by Grattan people, useful at Grattan, but also used outside of the Institute. 5.1 The tidyverse! The tidyverse is central to our work at Grattan. The tidyverse is a collection of related R packages for importing, wrangling, exploring and visualising data in R. The packages are designed to work well together. You install the tidyverse in the usual way: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) The main packages in the tidyverse include: ggplot2 for making beautiful, customisable graphs dplyr for manipulating data frames tidyr for tidying your data readr for importing data from a broad range of formats purrr for functional programming stringr for manipulating strings of text All these packages (and more!) will automatically be loaded for you when you run the command1: library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1.9000 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1.9000 ✔ purrr 0.3.2 ## ✔ tibble 2.1.3 ✔ dplyr 0.8.3 ## ✔ tidyr 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.4.0 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() A range of other packages are installed on your machine as part of the tidyverse. These include: readxl for importing Excel spreadsheets into R haven for importing Stata, SAS and SPSS data lubridate for working with dates rvest for scraping websites Although these packages are installed as part of the tidyverse, they aren’t loaded automatically when you run library(tidyverse). You’ll need to load them individually, like: library(lubridate) library(readxl) 5.1.1 Why do we use the tidyverse? The tidyverse makes life easier! The core tidyverse packages, like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr, are extremely popular. The tidyverse is probably the most popular ‘dialect’ of R. This means that any problem you encounter with the tidyverse will have been encountered many times before by other R users, so a solution will only be a Google search away. The tidyverse packages are all designed to work well together, with a consistent underlying philosophy and design. This means that coding habits you learn with one tidyverse package, like dplyr, are also applicable to other packages, like tidyr. They’re designed to work with data frames2, a rectangular data object that will be familiar to spreadsheet users that is very intuitive and convenient for the sort of work we do at Grattan. In particular, the tidyverse is built around the concept of tidy data, which has a specific meaning in this context that we’ll come to later. The fact that tidyverse packages are all built around one type of data object makes them easier to work with. The creator of the tidyverse, Hadley Wickham, places great value on code that is expressive and comprehensible to humans. This means that code written in the tidyverse idiom is often able to be understood even if you haven’t encountered the functions before. For example, look at this chunk of code: my_data %&gt;% filter(age &gt;= 30) %&gt;% mutate(relative_income = income / mean(income)) Without knowing what my_data looks like, and even if you haven’t encountered these functions before, this should be reasonably intuitive. We’re taking some data, and then3 only keeping observations that relate to people aged 30 and older, then calculating a new variable, relative_income. The name of a tidyverse function - like filter, group_by, summarise, and so on - generally gives you a pretty good idea what the function is going to do with your data, which isn’t always the case with other approaches. Here’s one way to do the same thing in base R: transform(my_data[my_data$age &gt;= 30, ], relative_income = income / mean(income)) The base R code gets the job done, but it’s clunkier, less expressive, and harder to read. Code written with tidyverse functions is often faster than its base R equivalents. But most of our work at Grattan is with small-to-medium sized datasets (with fewer than a million rows or so), so speed isn’t usually a major concern.4 The most valuable resource we deal with at Grattan is our time. Computers are cheap, people are not. If your code executes quickly, but it takes your colleague many hours to decipher it, the cost of the extra QC time more than outweighs the saving through faster computation. The tidyverse packages strike a good balance between expressive, comprehensible code and computational efficiency. Most R scripts at Grattan should start with library(tidyverse). Most of your work will be in data frames, and most of the time the tidyverse contains the core tools you’ll need to do that work. 5.2 Grattan-specific packages A range of Grattan people have written packages that come in handy at Grattan. 5.3 Other commonly-used packages "],
