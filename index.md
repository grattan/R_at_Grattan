# Welcome! {-}

This guide is designed for everyone who uses - or would like to use - R at Grattan Institute. 

The goal of this guide is to make it easy - even fun! - to use R at Grattan, whether you're doing analysis or reviewing someone else's analysis.

The guide does two main things:

1. Sets out some guidelines and good practices when using R at Grattan.
2. Shows you how to use R to undertake some of the analytical tasks you're likely to undertake at Grattan.

As a guide to using R, this website is helpful but incomplete. We can't possibly cover - or anticipate - all the skills you might need to know. If you make it to the end of this guide and want to learn more, start by reading [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It's free, and it is very good.

Because the guide is intended for everyone who uses R at Grattan, there may be some material that is too basic for more experienced users, or material that goes over the heads of beginners. That's OK - just skip those bits for now.

Any complaints or comments about this guide can be sent to Will or James, respectively.
